For users who are not familiar with spreadsheets since it's not a main part of their job to use them and yet they become handy to keep track of their data, it may be overwhelming to see so many features in display. It's a frequent scenario that users of spreadsheets are interested on using them as a database for very specific purposes. This application will facilitate the tasks of an elementary school teacher related to the management of records of his/her students. The project is intended to become a feasible solution for a bigger scope of users over time. However, it'll start as a personal project that will satisfy the needs of a family member of mine, with whom I've been iterating on requirements specifications.
